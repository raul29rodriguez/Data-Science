'''Exercise 4
Using the original 2 Ã—4 Numpy array from Ex. 3 filled with Fall and Spring integer grades,
first flatten it to 1D array using deep copy. Second, create a Panda Series that consists of the
elements of the 1D array. Third, print Series and produce descriptive statistics of Series by calling
the respective built-in method'''
